                                    It's expected that the album won't be ready for a couple of years.
                                    However, in the meantime Dillinger announced that they'll be performing Live
                                    at a variety of different locations across Scotland. 
                                    A location  and date for Aberdeen have been set - visit our Events page for

                                <p>With an increasing amount of our Society members looking to start their own projects,
                                    or just looking for a place to jam with friends. We've decided to invest into a new Club House. 
                                    Although our current one has served us well, space and equipment are limited. 
                                    We're looking to collect donations to place down a deposit for a new one. 
                                    Our plan is to invest into new equipment and editing software along with the club house, 
                                    making it easier for all memebers to create their own music. 
                                    We're considering keeping both club houses, making it easier for members to rent time in them.
                                    However, that will depend on the amount collected. 
                                    To place donation or for any further enquires, contact Dave Lombardo.</p>
