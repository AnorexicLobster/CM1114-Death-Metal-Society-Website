    <!-- Threat Model -->
    <!--
    Threat Source: External
    Threat Agent: Human
    Threat Intention: Intentional
    Threat Motivation: Using someone's login details to gain access to the rest of the site. 
                        - As a result defaming Members or the Society as a whole, 
                        or using that information to gain access to other accounts.

    Threat Impact: Damage to the rest of the website, access to a member's or 
                    the Societies more personal details, 
                    defacement of Society members by altering the content of the website,
                    or by publishing/ using any sensitive information. 

    Threat Mitigation: Login validation, email/text authentication upon login, 
                        ensuring that the password is hidden when being typed.
                        - Recommend that members use complex passwords which are difficult to remember. 
                        - Regularly change passwords.
                        - Create unconventional Security Questions.
                        - Only give specific Society departments to make changes to specific pages. 
                        That way even if someone with malicious intentions gains access to the website, 
                        they're scope would be limited.

                            <p>With an increasing amount of our Society members looking to start their own projects,
                                or just looking for a place to jam with friends. We've decided to invest into a new Club House. 
                                Although our current one has served us well, space and equipment are limited. 
                                We're looking to collect donations to place down a deposit for a new one. 
                                Our plan is to invest into new equipment and editing software along with the club house, 
                                making it easier for all memebers to create their own music. 
                                We're considering keeping both club houses, making it easier for members to rent time in them.
                                However, that will depend on the amount collected. 
                                To place donation or for any further enquires, contact Dave Lombardo.</p>
