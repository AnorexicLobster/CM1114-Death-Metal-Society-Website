    <!-- Threat Model -->
    <!--
    Threat Source: External
    Threat Agent: Human (AnonyMouse)
    Threat Intention: Intentional
    Threat Motivation: Using the Contact Us form to again spam the Society with
                        emails, or to submit inappropriate content to the Society. 
                        - Using the Twitter and Facebook feeds to harass the Society,
                        or gain sensitive information.
                        

    Threat Impact: Inappropriate submissions could make the Social teams job uncomfortable, 
                    which could again lead to dissatisfaction among the members, causing them to leave and 
                    in turn damaging the structure of the Society.
                    Alternatively, if the Society is spammed with emails, then organising this would be extremely time consuming, 
                    however, it could also lead to genuine queries being deleted (this could result in potentially new members not
                    getting the opportunity to join, or again result in existing members leaving - especially if they're
                    students who also need to focus on their Uni work). 

                    - The Social Media feeds could be used to gain sensitive information, which could then be used to harass members or to 
                    defame the Society as a whole. 
                    - This could lead to members feeling unsafe and leaving the Society, as a result damaging the 
                    whole Society. It could also deter new members from joining.


    Threat Mitigation: The first way to mitigate this threat is to firstly limit the email address to RGU emails. 
                        - This would significantly reduce the pool of potential emails being used for these attacks. 
                        - Furthermore, since the only way to carry these attacks out would be through stealing other students 
                        emails, it might mitigate the chance of the attack being carried out in the first place.
                        - Secondly, again, ensuring that the form checks that the relevant fields are being filled in would mean that
                        more work needs to be put into every attack. 
                        - Again, setting a timer before another enquiry can by sent (tracking this by email), would reduce the number of
                        Spam messages being sent. 
                        - Both the three above combined would also reduce the chances of things like inappropriate images 
                        being sent to the Society email. 
                        - Finally, not providing the Society email, anywhere on the site - this means that malicious parties, 
                        can only send enquiries to the Society email through the forms provided on the page. And would be unable to do so
                        through external sources.

                        To mitigate the Social media threat. 
                        - Firstly, ensuring that no sensitive information is present on the feed - i.e. through posts and images. 
                        - For any members who might feel uncomfortable. The event team should double check with the Society members
                        to ensure that they are comfortable with whats being posted (especially if it directly concerns them). 
                        This would mitigate the chances of members becoming dissatisfied, reducing the chances of the members leaving.
