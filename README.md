Card Flip Animation</br>
To get the Flip card Animation working, I used two references.
First Reference:</br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGVXmoZWZuw&list=PLR8vUZDE6IePk_KvVxrFwesjz8qspsIhd

Note: I used this reference for the CSS and HTML. However, the Javascript for this reference 
      wasn't doing what I was looking for. 
      
Second Reference:__
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66095959/flip-animation-for-multiple-cards

Note: I used this reference for the Javascript, the main reason for using this, was so that I could, 
      link all the different accordian panels with one function.
