    <!-- Threat Model -->
    <!--
    Threat Source: External
    Threat Agent: Human (AnonyMouse)
    Threat Intention: Intentional
    Threat Motivation: Using the information on the projects page to defame, 
                        or harass the members, or to gain access to the Society.
                        Potential theft of property. 

    Threat Impact: The Social Media links for each of the bands, 
                    could be used by malicious parties to harass the members, 
                    they could also be used to gain more sensitive information if the members are not careful.
                    This could be used to defame the members or Society, or to gain access to the Society as whole.
                    The band description also has information like the member names, and other information
                    about the band, along with sample tracks - which could be used for similar purposes. 
                    Another potential impact is related to the images on the projects page 
                    (the threat impact and mitigation is the same as that of the members and gallery pages).
                    

    Threat Mitigation: To mitigate the Social Media threat methods could include: 
                        - Ensuring that the account which is linked to the site is the band's Social Media page
                        and not individual member's Social Media.
                        -  Also ensuring that only information which is directly related to the band and not personal information is being posted 
                        on that Social Media. 
                        - In the case of harassment, it's also worth ensuring that all the members are 
                        comfortable with things like their name being on the Band Social Media/ Band description.
                        If any member is not comfortable with this - then leaving their full name out would be a 
                        potential solution (only using their first), or some kind of nickname. 
                        - Another potential way to mitigate the threats related to Social Media, is to recommend that 
                        each of the members set their individual Social Media accounts to private. 
                        That way even if all the previous safeguards are bypassed, then harmful parties will have a 
                        lot of difficultiy gaining any information which the member may deem sensitive. 

                        - To further protect the members and society from harm, it is also worth ensuring that
                        in the band description only information directly relevant is being included - such as;
                        influences, style, genre, description of the projects, etc. 
                        
                        - To safeguard against the theft of property - in this case the sample tracks, one of method
                        of achieving this is to ensure that the members have properly copyrighted their work, and they have 
                        valid evidence to substantiate their claims.
                        - Also ensuring that only a part of the song is added to the site, to give visitors an idea of the 
                        work. And then potentially redirecting them to something like YouTube, where more robust copyright measures
                        are in place would be another solution.

                                                <p>Snot's music is a potent fusion of raw aggression, infectious energy, 
                                                    and unapologetic attitude which epitomises the rebellious spirit of 90s Nu Metal. 
                                                    Emerging in the late 1990s, they epitomized the spirit of nu metal with their uncompromising sound and rebellious lyrics. 
                                                    Led by the charismatic Lynn Strait, their songs are driven by relentless guitar riffs, thunderous bass lines, and explosive percussion, 
                                                    creating a visceral sonic experience that grabs listeners by the throat. Strait's vocals range from fierce screams to melodic hooks, 
                                                    delivering lyrics that reflect the frustration and defiance of a generation. Tracks like "Stoopid" and "My Balls" 
                                                    showcase their signature blend of groove-heavy instrumentation and punk-inspired ferocity.
                                                    Their debut album "Get Some" stands as a testament to their raw talent and uncompromising attitude.</p>

                                                <p>Pantera's music is a visceral, primal force that transcends the confines of 
                                                    traditional heavy metal. Their sound is a potent blend of blistering guitar riffs, 
                                                    thunderous bass lines, and relentless drumming, all anchored by Phil Anselmo's 
                                                    commanding vocals. Each track is a sonic onslaught, characterized by its ferocity, 
                                                    aggression, and unrelenting intensity. Yet, within this maelstrom of sound, 
                                                    Pantera also exhibits a remarkable sense of groove and rhythm, 
                                                    drawing listeners in with infectious hooks and headbanging beats. 
                                                    From the bone-crushing heaviness of songs like "Domination" and "5 Minutes Alone" 
                                                    to the melodic complexity of tracks like "Cemetery Gates" and "Hollow," 
                                                    Pantera's music is a testament to their unparalleled musicianship and 
                                                    uncompromising attitude. It's a sound that speaks to the primal instincts within us all.</p>

                                                <p>Primus's music defies categorization, existing in a realm all its own. 
                                                    With a distinctive blend of funk, alternative rock, and experimental elements, 
                                                    Primus crafts a sonic experience that is both quirky and captivating. Led by the virtuosic bass playing of Les Claypool, 
                                                    their sound is characterized by intricate bass lines, unconventional song structures, 
                                                    and off-kilter lyrics that often explore themes of absurdity and satire. 
                                                    Claypool's distinct vocal delivery, accompanied by Larry "Ler" LaLonde's unconventional guitar work 
                                                    and Tim "Herb" Alexander's dynamic drumming, creates a musical landscape that is as unpredictable as it is irresistible. 
                                                    With their eccentric style and fearless experimentation, 
                                                    Primus continues to defy expectations and push the boundaries.</p>

                                                <p>The Dillinger Escape Plan's music is an electrifying whirlwind of chaos and innovation 
                                                    that defies conventional boundaries. Formed in the late 1990s, 
                                                    they pioneered the mathcore genre with their unparalleled technicality, ferocious intensity, 
                                                    and avant-garde approach. Their sound is characterized by frenetic guitar riffs, complex rhythms, 
                                                    and unpredictable song structures, creating a sonic experience that is both exhilarating and 
                                                    disorienting. Frontman Greg Puciato's dynamic vocals range from guttural screams to 
                                                    haunting melodies, adding another layer of intensity to their music. Tracks like "43% Burnt" 
                                                    and "Prancer" showcase their ability to seamlessly blend aggression with intricacy. 
                                                    Their current project, ‘Calculating Infinity’ is full of raw emotion, technical precision, 
                                                    and uncompromising creativity.</p>
